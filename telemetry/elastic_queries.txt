Here is list of queries that I prepared:
________________________________________________________________________________

1. A query that returns the count of registered players per day

POST user_register/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "createdAt",
        "calendar_interval": "day"
      }
    }
  }
}

________________________________________________________________________________

2. A query that returns the top 10 posts (by the number of comments) per day in the last
10 days (the results donâ€™t have to be 100% accurate, but the general idea needs to
be followed).
